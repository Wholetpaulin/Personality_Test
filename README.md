# Personality_Test
This is a handmade myers briggs personality test.  The questions and answers were taken from this slideshow: https://www.lusd.org/cms/lib6/CA01001399/Centricity/Domain/711/THE%20MYERS-BRIGGS.pdf

This is in no way an accurate or representative test and is no way associated with offical myers briggs tests. 
I gave this application a personailty test theme to make it fun!
